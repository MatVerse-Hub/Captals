## Slide 2: Problem

### DeFi's Critical Challenges

**$48B+ locked in DeFi protocols, but:**

🔴 **No standardized risk metrics**
- Investors lack reliable assessment tools
- "Do your own research" is insufficient
- 90% of DeFi projects fail within 18 months

🔴 **Information asymmetry**
- Complex protocols intimidate users
- Opaque tokenomics and governance
- High barrier to entry

🔴 **Inefficient capital allocation**
- Yield farming without risk consideration
- Impermanent loss surprises
- Lack of portfolio diversification tools

**Market Gap**: Need for institutional-grade DeFi with retail accessibility

## Slide 3: Solution

### Introducing Omega Capitals

**The Ω-Score System**
```
Ω = (Ψ × Θ) / (CVaR + 1) + PoLE
```
Proprietary metric combining:
- Asset Quality (Ψ)
- Risk-Adjusted Returns (Θ)
- Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)
- Liquidity Efficiency (PoLE)

**Tokenized Products**
- 🏦 Ω-Funds: ETF-like investment vehicles
- 📜 Evidence Notes: Soulbound NFT certificates
